Is just a fun fact, copied and pasted from CHAT GPT 4 prompt:

-> Why in 2020 git takes the option to deprecate master and start to use main?

The decision to deprecate "master" in favor of "main" as the default branch name in Git was part of a broader effort to address the use of potentially offensive or exclusionary language in technology. The term "master" has connotations of slavery, with "master" and "slave" historically being used to describe relationships of dominance and control. While the usage of "master" in Git and other software contexts wasn't originally intended to reference slavery, the move to "main" was seen as a positive step towards more inclusive language in technology.

This change was part of a broader movement within the tech industry to reconsider and replace terms that could be seen as harmful or exclusionary. By switching to "main," Git and the broader developer community sought to create a more inclusive environment for all users.

The change was officially made by GitHub in 2020, which set "main" as the default branch name for new repositories, though users still have the option to rename their branches as they see fit. Other platforms and tools have also adopted similar changes.
